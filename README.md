SalesTaxes program is a very simple c# console applicatione mainly focuses on calcaulating sales taxes and print  the invoice out.

Here I enlist some approches , that I keep in my mind to be very close from them:
•	Clean coding standards.
•	Reach model.
•	Domain driven design in isolation the bounded context however it is only one and it is the core.
•	I followed the naming conventions and naming rules with the help of jet brain resharper.
•	I Reduced complexity by separation of concern and simpler code as I could.
•	I Used Dependency injection for losing coupling.
•	My instance  variables are explanatory and less as possible.
•	I used encapsulation  to encapsulate my business logic and local variables and I hide internal structure.
•	Functions are small and do one functionality to follow single responsibility principle as one of solid princples.
•	My unit tests are small , readable , fast , Independent and and one assert per one logic.
•	The code is easy to change with no side effects and also my unit test covers my code and Continiuos integration ensure system heath.
•	 The software will not break in many places due to single change.
•	I did my best to make my code understandable for others No complexity , no repetition
